robots.txt
The file robots.txt is often used on webpages to tell web crawlers how they should access or disallow them from parts of the website,
for example to hide irrelevant results from Google search or prevent the server from overloading from crawlers loading content.

http://{ip}/robots.txt shows there are /whatever and /.hidden directories on the website

dirbuster {ip}/whatever/ directory
http://10.12.179.218/whatever/ has "htpasswd" file 
htpasswd file contents: "root:8621ffdbc5698829397d97767ac13db3"
username root, password is md5 encrypted and decrypts to "dragon"
password doesn't work on the login but trying out subdirectories we find {ip}/admin
login on {ip}/admin

Directory traversal

Following many of the links there is a pattern of a url with a parameter "?page=" for example: http://{ip}/?page=survey
Trying to add http://{ip}/?page=../ we see interesting alert messages with each added ../ which seems like a sign there is a directory we can access using this.
One of the messages is "You can DO it !!!  :]" and after trying out the common files an attacker would try to access we finally get 
http://{ip}/?page=../../../../../../../etc/passwd which gives the flag.

Unrestricted file upload of a malicious type
The "Add Image" page does not let you upload files unless they have a .jpg extension.
Looking at the request there is the filename and Content-Type. When a .jpg file is uploaded, it has the Content-Type of image/jpeg. 
However when sending a request with another file extension in the filename but still with Content-Type: image/jpeg we are allowed to upload whatever files we want, 
for example javascript that might then be executed on another user's browser when they view it. Doing this gives us the flag.
